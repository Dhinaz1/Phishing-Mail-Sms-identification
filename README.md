Phishing is the most prevalent method of cybercrime that convinces people to provide sensitive information; for instance, account IDs, passwords, and bank details. Emails, instant messages, and phone calls are widely used to launch such cyber-attacks. Despite constant updating of the methods of avoiding such cyber-attacks, the ultimate outcome is currently inadequate. On the other hand, phishing emails have increased exponentially in recent years, which suggests a need for more effective and advanced methods to counter them. Numerous methods have been established to filter phishing emails, but the problem still needs a complete solution ,This project explores the possibility of using  Logistic Regression with Select by Weight and XGradient Boost Tree for developed spam filtering to make spam filters more advanced. The model has been built using Logistic Regression with Select by Weight and XGradient Boost Tree showing a good result. Accuracy generated from the mentioned models is 95.13%.
